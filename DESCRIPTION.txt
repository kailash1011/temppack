This is a highly precise module with simple ways to convert temperature from one unit to another.

Hey!! So you are on the Right track.
Do not waste your time in simply writing unnecessary codes.
Download it!!

For eg: If you want to convert 50 rankine to celsius:
Just import the module. There we have our built-in-functions.
For this one use celstorank(50) <----- Note you need to pass the value of the base unit as parameter
& get the converted unit as your result.

However, passing a non-int or a non-float value may raise an error.
Try avoiding such errors.
Rest Everything is miracle!!
